# CrowdFundChain - Decentralized Crowdfunding Platform

Welcome to CrowdFundChain, a decentralized crowdfunding platform built with React and blockchain technology. CrowdFundChain empowers users to create crowdfunding events and raise funds securely and transparently using blockchain smart contracts.

## About the Project
